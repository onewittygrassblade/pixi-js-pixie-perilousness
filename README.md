# pixi-js-pixie-perilousness

This side scroller was inspired by the tutorial [Learn PixiJS](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learnPixiJS).

## Getting started

### Playing

This game is designed to be played in a browser using a keyboard. It will not work on mobile devices.

* Goal of the game: get Pixie home safe by guiding her through four levels full of obstacles!
* Keep Space pressed to make Pixie flap her wings.
* Avoid the green blocks! That is, unless you are temporarily invincible. If you are, enjoy the cute pop sound they make as they disappear into the ether.
* Collect presents if you can! Some of them contain stars, others contain surprises which will apply a temporary random effect. You will get a rating based on the number of stars you collected when you finish the game.
* I know, winter level sucks.
